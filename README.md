# PWA-Text-Editor

## Description

Just Another Text Editor (J.A.T.E) is a standard text editor with data persistence. It can be used with or without an internet connection so that notes can be recovered at any time. It can also be downloaded by going to the render link and clicking the download button on the right side of the search bar.

## Installation

Here is a link to the application deployed on render : https://pwa-text-editor-snpo.onrender.com/. As mentioned before, if you wish to download the application, click on the download button on the right hand side of the search bar.

## Credits

Starter code was used for this assignment. I did not fully create this project, but instead added service workers, a manifest file, CSS loaders, and babel. Here is a link to the original starter code: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/cautious-meme
